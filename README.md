There are three csv files and three R scripts here. Each csv file and script correspond to one of the study locations.
LL = London Lakes
Q = the Quoin
Dun = Mt Sturgeon (Dunkeld)
Each script reads in the appropriate data file.
The necessary packages to run the files are attached to the top of LLFinalScript.
These scripts include a number of tests which were not included in the final analysis, as well as scripts for running diagnostic plots for models and for testing model fit.
